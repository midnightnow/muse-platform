Subject: MUSE Platform - Mathematical Music Discovery Engine

Hi Seiya,

Following up on our discussion about music and code, I'm sharing MUSE - a platform that treats creativity as mathematical discovery rather than generation.

Core concept: We use sacred geometry (golden ratio φ, Fibonacci sequences) to discover pre-existing musical forms in the Platonic realm, similar to how your "OS in 1000 Lines" reveals the essential nature of operating systems.

Key files to review:
1. sacred_geometry_calculator.py - Mathematical foundations (φ, Fibonacci, π)
2. frequency_engine.py - 12 Muse archetypes mapped to frequencies (432-963 Hz)
3. predictive_music_engine.py - Golden melodies, Fibonacci rhythms, scale generation
4. MuseSoundEngine.tsx - Real-time Web Audio synthesis with ADSR envelopes

The system maps personality traits to archetypal frequencies, then uses Pythagorean intervals and golden ratio progressions to generate actual music.

I've included audio demos:
- muse_golden_ratio_demo.wav - Hear the golden ratio in action
- muse_fibonacci_rhythm_demo.mid - Fibonacci rhythm patterns for your DAW
- muse_comparison_demo.wav - Golden ratio vs equal temperament comparison

I'd particularly value your thoughts on:
- The mathematical approach to creativity (discovery vs generation)
- System architecture and API design (FastAPI + React/TypeScript)
- Balance between determinism and variation in musical output
- Whether synthesis should move to AudioWorklet for tighter timing

The attached package includes everything needed to run locally. See EVALUATION.md for a complete guide with smoke tests and architectural review points.
